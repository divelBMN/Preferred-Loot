# Preferred-Loot
The project demonstrates the ability of a neuron to help a player with a loot pick up.
The neuron watches the user's preferences (the quality of the item in the loot list) and in the following loot lists pre-selects items with preferred quality.
***
During the game process, you can change your preferences in quality. Neuron will be retrained.
